# Spotify Song Analyzer

The notebooks in this directory are part of a series of explorations into using Python to analyze songs from Spotify. Follow the link to the original Google Colab notebook to epxerience the interactivity of the project as intended!

## Part 1: Interactive Spotify Downloader 

In this project, we use the spotdl library to interactively download songs and playlists from Spotify. In the Google Colab notebook, widgets are provided in certain cells to enable interactivity.

## Part 2: Analyzing Song Key and BPM

Part 2 of this project expands on the first part by using librosa, spleeter, and an implementation of the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm to find the key and BPM of a Spotify song. We explore using machine learning models in our analysis to improve performance.
